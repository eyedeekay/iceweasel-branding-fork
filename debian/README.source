firefox-branding-ui2pbrowser for Debian
-------------------------------------

Build dependencies on librsvg2-bin and xsltproc are inherited from the original
ui2pbrowser source package.

This package is mostly Debian-specific and therefore natively packaged. This
does not hinder non-Debian builds though.

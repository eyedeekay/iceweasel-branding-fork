# Unofficial i2p Browser Branding Modification Plugin

This is a fork of the iceweasel branding plugin intended to enable rebranding
a browser to call itself "Unofficial i2p Browser"

It was done in 20 minutes late one night when I was frustrated with my attempts
to rebrand a modern Firefox non-invasively. It was done without any real input
or approval from anybody, not Mozilla, Tor, Debian, i2p, i2pd, privacysolutions,
or anybody else. Honestly Firefox is kinda bumming me out in alot of ways
though.
